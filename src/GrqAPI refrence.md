[Create chat completion](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#chat-create)

POSThttps://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions

Creates a model response for the given chat conversation.

### 

[Request Body](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#chat-create-request-body)

* messagesarrayRequired  
A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.  
### Show possible types
* modelstringRequired  
ID of the model to use. For details on which models are compatible with the Chat API, see available [models](https://console.groq.com/docs/models)
* citation\_optionsstring or nullOptionalDefaults to enabled  
Allowed values: `enabled, disabled`  
Whether to enable citations in the response. When enabled, the model will include citations for information retrieved from provided documents or web searches.
* compound\_customobject or nullOptional  
Custom configuration of models and tools for Compound.  
### Show properties
* disable\_tool\_validationbooleanOptionalDefaults to false  
If set to true, groq will return called tools without validating that the tool is present in request.tools. tool\_choice=required/none will still be enforced, but the request cannot require a specific tool be used.
* documentsarray or nullOptional  
A list of documents to provide context for the conversation. Each document contains text that can be referenced by the model.  
### Show properties
* exclude\_domainsDeprecatedarray or nullOptional  
Deprecated: Use search\_settings.exclude\_domains instead. A list of domains to exclude from the search results when the model uses a web search tool.
* frequency\_penaltynumber or nullOptionalDefaults to 0  
Range: \-2 - 2  
This is not yet supported by any of our models. Number between -2.0 and 2.0\. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
* function\_callDeprecatedstring / object or nullOptional  
Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.  
Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function.  
`none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if functions are present.  
### Show possible types
* functionsDeprecatedarray or nullOptional  
Deprecated in favor of `tools`.  
A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.  
### Show properties
* include\_domainsDeprecatedarray or nullOptional  
Deprecated: Use search\_settings.include\_domains instead. A list of domains to include in the search results when the model uses a web search tool.
* include\_reasoningboolean or nullOptional  
Whether to include reasoning in the response. If true, the response will include a `reasoning` field. If false, the model's reasoning will not be included in the response. This field is mutually exclusive with `reasoning_format`.
* logit\_biasobject or nullOptional  
This is not yet supported by any of our models. Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.
* logprobsboolean or nullOptionalDefaults to false  
This is not yet supported by any of our models. Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`.
* max\_completion\_tokensinteger or nullOptional  
The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.
* max\_tokensDeprecatedinteger or nullOptional  
Deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`. The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.
* metadataobject or nullOptional  
This parameter is not currently supported.
* ninteger or nullOptionalDefaults to 1  
Range: 1 - 1  
How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that the current moment, only n=1 is supported. Other values will result in a 400 response.
* parallel\_tool\_callsboolean or nullOptionalDefaults to true  
Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.
* presence\_penaltynumber or nullOptionalDefaults to 0  
Range: \-2 - 2  
This is not yet supported by any of our models. Number between -2.0 and 2.0\. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
* reasoning\_effortstring or nullOptional  
Allowed values: `none, default, low, medium, high`  
qwen3 models support the following values Set to 'none' to disable reasoning. Set to 'default' or null to let Qwen reason.  
openai/gpt-oss-20b and openai/gpt-oss-120b support 'low', 'medium', or 'high'. 'medium' is the default value.
* reasoning\_formatstring or nullOptional  
Allowed values: `hidden, raw, parsed`  
Specifies how to output reasoning tokens This field is mutually exclusive with `include_reasoning`.
* response\_formatobject / object / object or nullOptional  
An object specifying the format that the model must output. Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. `json_schema` response format is only available on [supported models](https://console.groq.com/docs/structured-outputs#supported-models). Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema` is preferred for models that support it.  
### Show possible types
* search\_settingsobject or nullOptional  
Settings for web search functionality when the model uses a web search tool.  
### Show properties
* seedinteger or nullOptional  
If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.
* service\_tierstring or nullOptional  
Allowed values: `auto, on_demand, flex, performance, null`  
The service tier to use for the request. Defaults to `on_demand`.

  * `auto` will automatically select the highest tier available within the rate limits of your organization.
  * `flex` uses the flex tier, which will succeed or fail quickly.
* stopstring / array or nullOptional  
Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.  
### Show possible types
* storeboolean or nullOptional  
This parameter is not currently supported.
* streamboolean or nullOptionalDefaults to false  
If set, partial message deltas will be sent. Tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent%5Fevents/Using%5Fserver-sent%5Fevents#Event%5Fstream%5Fformat) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. [Example code](https://console.groq.com/docs/text-chat#streaming-a-chat-completion).
* stream\_optionsobject or nullOptional  
Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.  
### Show properties
* temperaturenumber or nullOptionalDefaults to 1  
Range: 0 - 2  
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2\. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top\_p but not both.
* tool\_choicestring / object or nullOptional  
Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.  
`none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools are present.  
### Show possible types
* toolsarray or nullOptional  
A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.  
### Show properties
* top\_logprobsinteger or nullOptional  
Range: 0 - 20  
This is not yet supported by any of our models. An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.
* top\_pnumber or nullOptionalDefaults to 1  
Range: 0 - 1  
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.
* userstring or nullOptional  
A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help us monitor and detect abuse.

### 

[Response Object](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#chat-create-returns)

[Create transcription](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#audio-transcription)

POSThttps://api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions

Transcribes audio into the input language.

### 

[Request Body](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#audio-transcription-request-body)

* modelstringRequired  
ID of the model to use. `whisper-large-v3` and `whisper-large-v3-turbo` are currently available.
* filestringOptional  
The audio file object (not file name) to transcribe, in one of these formats: flac, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, ogg, wav, or webm. Either a file or a URL must be provided. Note that the file field is not supported in Batch API requests.
* languagestringOptional  
The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in [ISO-639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%5Fof%5FISO%5F639-1%5Fcodes) format will improve accuracy and latency.
* promptstringOptional  
An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment. The [prompt](https://console.groq.com/docs/speech-text) should match the audio language.
* response\_formatstringOptionalDefaults to json  
Allowed values: `json, text, verbose_json`  
The format of the transcript output, in one of these options: `json`, `text`, or `verbose_json`.
* temperaturenumberOptionalDefaults to 0  
The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1\. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use [log probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log%5Fprobability) to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.
* timestamp\_granularities\[\]arrayOptionalDefaults to segment  
The timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. `response_format` must be set `verbose_json` to use timestamp granularities. Either or both of these options are supported: `word`, or `segment`. Note: There is no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency.
* urlstringOptional  
The audio URL to translate/transcribe (supports Base64URL). Either a file or a URL must be provided. For Batch API requests, the URL field is required since the file field is not supported.

### 

[Response Object](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#audio-transcription-returns)
